# Survey of Color Rules of Bootstrap 4.5

## Purpose

This is not a great project, but what I do need.

When I want to change the primary color in Bootstrap, how can I decide other colors?

This is the basic motivation of this web.

## Acknowledgments

I sincerely appreciate Mr. [Gregor Aisch](https://github.com/gka) who has created the [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js).

I started this simple project when I'd realized the existence of the *chroma.js*.

I'd known [Chromatist](https://github.com/jrus/chromatist) and [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3), but they hadn't been enough for me. And since I have no experience in Python, so I haven't checked [GrapeFruit](https://github.com/xav/Grapefruit) and [colors.py](https://github.com/mattrobenolt/colors.py).

If this simple HTML solves my purpose, I may create a package that will use the *chroma.js* as the top of dependencies.

## LICENSE

As I'm planning to create a package that will depend on the *chroma.js*, I release this simple app under [The 3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
